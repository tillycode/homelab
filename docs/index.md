# Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create a reproducible and scalable infrastructure for personal use.
This project utilizes GitOps principles and declarative configurations to achieve this objective.
There are three main types of declarative configurations involved:

1. **Terraform**: For provisioning infrastructure resources.
2. **NixOS**: For configuring the operating system.
3. **Kubernetes**: For deploying applications.

There are still many design decisions to be made.
This section aims to document those decisions.
